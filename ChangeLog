	* onenetd.c: Removed redundant test for host being "0" (since
	inet_addr handles this case already). Changed uid and gid to
	longs, since uid_t and gid_t aren't signed under dietlibc. Made
	help a bit more helpful. Removed malloc debugging code.

	* onenetd.c: Due to missing features on Solaris: removed "kill IP
	options", replaced setenv with putenv, replaced inet_ntoa with
	inet_addr.

	* onenetd.c: Added escape characters in response string.
